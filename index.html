There is no god, Summer; gotta rip that band-aid off now you'll thank me later. Oh, we're welllll past that, Jerry! Cool. Just stay in the driveway; the kill-bots are live, and I took you off the whitelist.

                                  <p> Sum-Sum, let’s go! Grandpa’s concern for your safety is fleeting! Yea. If you spend all day shuffling words around you can make anything sound bad, Morty. Holy crap, Morty, run! Run for your life, Morty, run! I-I've never seen that thing before in my life, Morty, I don't even know what the hell it is! We-we gotta get out of here, Morty, it's gonna kill us! We're gonna die, Morty! We're gonna die! We all wanna die, we're meeseeks!

                                      I wanna help you. But I can't give you this case, it don't belong to me. Besides, I've already been through too much shit this morning over this case to hand it over to your dumb ass.
